# Networking-Self-Study-Portfolio
This repository tracks my journey as I learn the fundamentals of network engineering. Iâ€™m building practical skills aligned with real job responsibilities and using tools like Packet Tracer, Wireshark, and Python. All labs and notes are designed to simulate what a junior network engineer might encounter in a real-world setting.
