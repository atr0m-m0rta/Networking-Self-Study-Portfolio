# Networking-Self-Study-Portfolio
This repository tracks my journey as I learn the fundamentals of network engineering. I’m building practical skills aligned with real job responsibilities and using tools like Packet Tracer, Wireshark, and Python. All labs and notes are designed to simulate what a junior network engineer might encounter in a real-world setting.
